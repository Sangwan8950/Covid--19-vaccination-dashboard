<p align="left">The objective of the project is to create a Tableau dashboard for tracking COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration. The dashboard aims to provide real-time visualizations and insights regarding the progress of vaccination efforts, including the number of doses administered, vaccination rates, and coverage across different regions or demographics. The goal is to help stakeholders, such as public health officials, policymakers, and the general public, monitor and understand the vaccination progress in an accessible and informative manner.</p>
